				Now when you pick a pawpaw <br>
				Or a prickly pear <br>
				And you prick a raw paw <br>
				Well, next time beware <br>
				Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw <br>
				When you pick a pear <br>
				Try to use the claw <br>
				But you don't need to use the claw <br>
				When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw; <br>
				Have I given you a clue? <br>

				"So just try and relax, yeah cool it <br>
				Fall apart in my backyard <br>
				'Cause let me tell you something, little britches <br>
				If you act like that bee acts - uh-uh <br>
				You're working too hard <br>
				And don't spend your time lookin' around <br>
				For something you want that can't be found" <br>
				When you find out you can live without it <br>
				 go along not thinkin' about it <br>
				I'll tell you something true <br>
