					Wherever I wander, wherever I roam <br>
					I couldn't be fonder of my big home <br>
					The bees are buzzin' in the tree <br>
					To make some honey just for me <br>
					When you look under the rocks and plants <br>
					And take a glance at the fancy ants <br>
					Then maybe try a few <br>

			Now when you pick a pawpaw
			Or a prickly pear
			And you prick a raw paw
			Well, next time beware
			Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
			When you pick a pear
			Try to use the claw
			But you don't need to use the claw
			When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw;
			Have I given you a clue?

			The bare necessities of life will come to you
			They'll come to you!

			"So just try and relax, yeah cool it
			Fall apart in my backyard
			'Cause let me tell you something, little britches
			If you act like that bee acts - uh-uh
			You're working too hard
			And don't spend your time lookin' around
			For something you want that can't be found"
			When you find out you can live without it
			 go along not thinkin' about it
			I'll tell you something true

			The bare necessities of life will come to you
